# BirdSpots

Link: http://www.birdspots.net

I had noticed that when my mom, an avid birdwatcher, went out on a trip, she took a whole bunch of high-tech gear with
her: DSLR, iPad mini, expensive binoculars, etc... She also took with her a book to record her bird sightings. I figured 
that if she was going to have the iPad with her anyways, why not build an app to replace the book? 
BirdSpots is that app. It allows the user to record the bird spotted (choose from a database of over 4500 birds), the date, 
the location (with Google Maps integration), and any custom remarks. Bird watchers are able to see all of their past entries 
in a chronological list, and also as markers on a map. It allows Birders to leave the pen and paper diary at home and record 
their entries in a more user-friendly and permanent way.
